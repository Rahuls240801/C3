Kidney cancer is among the 10 most common cancers in both men and women. Overall, the lifetime risk for developing kidney cancer in men is about 1 in 46 (2.02%). Diagnosis of Kidney cancer at an early stage helps doctors to decide which treatment will work best. The natural history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is highly unpredictable and challenging, but it provides the best chance for cure. Current diagnosis of renal cancer consists of histopathologic examination of tissue sections and classification into tumor stages and grades of malignancy. We aimed to develop an improved cancer prediction system by using the deep learning techniques, which automates the classification of Renal Cell Carcinoma Levels and also for identification of features using histopathological images. We trained and validated Graph neural networks (GNNâ€™s) on whole-slide images to distinguish Renal Cell Carcinoma from normal tissue with comparatively improved classification accuracy. At a more fundamental level, it is evident that this system with deep learning techniques is helping to improve our basic understanding of cancer development and progression.
